The additional Java Agent will connect to a discoBit repository, fetch remote properties via configuration UUID and finally inject those into the system context when Hybris is bootstrapped.\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for details on setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal README.md:\r\n\r\ndiscoBit - Remote Application Configuration Management\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*discoBit is a service which enables remote configuration of applications.\r\nConfigurations are read from the central server during bootstrap or on demand by your software.*\r\n\r\n#About\r\nInstead of providing each installed application, script or process with local configuration you shift everything to a central instance which serves as a single point of truth. All properties are organized in configuration buckets which are uniquely identified and secured from unauthorized access.\r\n\r\nYour software calls the central service cluster via REST and reads the applied properties when appropriate. You need to provide a single remote-configuration-ID or a unique identifier for the calling node (hostname, IP) and security credentials to access the remote configuration.\r\n\r\nApply changes to your configs for massive infrastructures without any need for rollouts or restarts.\r\n\r\nSee www.discobit.com\r\n\r\n# Java Client Library - Usage\r\nThis library eases access to the REST based API for discoBit. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
