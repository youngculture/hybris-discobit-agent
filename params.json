Apply the Java Agent to the Tomcat wrapper configuration together with the unique identifier for the calling node and security credentials to access the remote configuration. The properties are injected to the system context.\r\n\r\ndiscoBit will provide inheritable configurations in a future release, so you can merge your local./env./advanced.properties in one go.\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for details on setup.\r\n\r\nSee www.discobit.com\r\n","google":"UA-54394896-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
